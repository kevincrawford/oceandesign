    <p>The above grid makes use of the 3 default filters available by the 'filterType' value on the column - text, dateRange, and numberRange.
        It also uses a custom field-specific filter on Status, and gets no filter on the "Unfilterable" column because no filterType was specified, and no field-specific filter was defined.
        The filters that are applied are listed below as the JSON object passed to the dataSource method.</p>
    <p>If you provide your own custom filter, use a <code>wh-field</code> attribute to restrict it to a certain field, or <code>wh-field-type</code> attribute to restrict it to all columns with a
       matching filterType property.  By default, you just need to manage the 'value' property - your HTML will get wrapped with buttons that manage copying the value to 'realValue' and closing the popup.
       If you want to handle that part too, add a wh-custom attribute to your div as well.</p>
    <p>NOTE: while all the filters you can apply are passed to the dataSource method, it doesn't actually do anything for some values that get passed, as it's just an example implementation.</p>
